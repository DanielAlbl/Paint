\begin{DoxyParagraph}{Description\+:}
This program allows the user to draw rectangles, ellipses and lines, both filled and unfilled. Each shape can be drawn in any combination of colors displayed in the color palette by selecting the color and shape with the left mouse button, then dragging on the black field. Upon release, the shape will be created. Once the shapes have been created, the user can move them using the right mouse button in the same way the shape was created. By pressing ‘d’ the top shape will be deleted, and ‘c’ clears the entire screen. Both ‘q’ and Esc will exit the program and any other key will redraw the entire screen. This program is dependent on Free\+Glut for graphical support and requires related library’s.
